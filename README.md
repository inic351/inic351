# Hi, I'm Ian Nicolle 👋

I build scalable, cloud-native applications with a focus on **DevOps** and **Clean Architecture**.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C# (.NET 8)
- **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, Beanstalk, S3 etc...)
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform, GitHub Actions, Docker

### 🚀 Featured Portfolio Projects

| Project | Core Tech | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[CloudVault](https://github.com/inic351/cloud-vault)** | `C#` `Python` `Terraform` | A multi-language hybrid cloud storage solution using **Beanstalk** for the dashboard and **Lambda** for file processing. |

### 🏗️ Architectural Philosophy
In my projects, I prioritize:
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Everything is provisioned via Terraform—no manual AWS console clicks.
* **Polyglot Programming:** Using the right tool for the job (e.g., Python for data, C# for performance).
* **Automated CI/CD:** Every push runs unit tests and triggers a `terraform plan` to ensure infrastructure integrity.
